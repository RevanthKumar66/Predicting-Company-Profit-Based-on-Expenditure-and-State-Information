# Predicting-Company-Profit-Based-on-Expenditure-and-State-Information
Developing a profit prediction model based on company expenses and operational factors ðŸ“ˆðŸ’°.

1. **EDA Environment Setup**: Prepare the environment for exploratory data analysis.
2. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant data for the analysis.
3. **The dataset consists of the following columns:**
 - Productivity_Exp: Amount spent on productivity-related expenses (in thousands of dollars).
 - Management_Exp: Amount spent on management-related expenses (in thousands of dollars).
 - Promotions_Exp: Amount spent on promotional activities (in thousands of dollars).
 - State: The state in which the company operates.
 - Profit: The profit of the company (in thousands of dollars)
4. **Asking Questions**:
    - Explore common features during data analysis.
    - Understand the correlation coefficient between productivity expenses and profit.
    - Investigate the impact of promotional expenses on profits.
    - Analyze profit distribution across different states using box plots.
    - Examine the relationship between features and profit.
    - Learn about one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
    - Understand the purpose of min-max scaling in data preprocessing.
    - Quantify the effectiveness of expenditure categories on profit.
    - Split data into training and testing sets for machine learning.
    - Identify the initial model for training.
    - Choose appropriate metrics for model evaluation.
    - Evaluate model performance using linear regression coefficients.
5. **Initial Checkup**: Explore the dataset's structure, null values, and potential features.
6. **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to gain insights.
7. **Feature Engineering**: Enhance features for modeling.
8. **Model Training**: Train the predictive model.
9. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance.
10. **Model Interpretation**: Understand the key drivers of profit.

In conclusion, The model effectively predicts profit, with productivity playing a significant role. Promotions, however, do not seem to strongly impact profit, and state-based differences are notable. ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¡
